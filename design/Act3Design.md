# Act III: Trials and Revelations

## Narrative Overview

Elior leaves t### Storytelling Quest (Spans All Three Locations)

-   Name: Echoes of the Hidden Bond
    -   Type: Storytelling Quest
    -   Trigger: Pick up the keepsake note from Mira's Hut at the start of Act III
    -   Structure: Three linked discoveries, one at each relic site
    -   Objectives:
        1. Sunken Ruins — Recover the Sea‑Sealed Letter fragment preserved in a coral reliquary
        2. Mount Ember — Read the Charred Inscription etched into cooled lava near the mirror terraces
        3. Caverns of Shadow — Hear the Dragon's Memory, a spoken recollection naming Elior's parents and the ward they forged
    -   Completion: Assemble the three testimonies into a single account explaining how Elior was hidden from Malakar
    -   Story Impact: Clarifies parentage and motive without altering main progression Forest carrying the echo of Nyx’s last words: “Power follows purpose; purpose follows truth.” The air feels thinner now, charged with the knowledge that Malakar holds King Alden captive and leeches his life to call forth a kingdom-wide curse. The path ahead is no longer about learning who Elior might become—it is about deciding the kind of person he will be while the kingdom watches.

Act III unfolds as a pilgrimage across Eldoria to recover three ancient relics—each bound to a virtue that shapes Elior’s character: Courage, Wisdom, and Selflessness. As Elior travels with Mira and Sir Cedric, he confronts enemies and riddles. He learns more of the creeping weight of his parents’ mystery. Rumors now speak plainly: Malakar once knew them, and he wants something that only Elior can unlock.

## Journey Between Relic Sites

Mira, drawing on her mastery of arcane teleportation, whisks the party between the distant relic sites. Her spells bend space, allowing Elior, Cedric, and herself to traverse Eldoria’s vast reaches in moments—first to the storm-lashed coast, then to the volcanic slopes, and finally deep beneath the hills. Each transition is marked by shimmering portals and brief glimpses of places left behind. After securing all three relics, Mira prepares one final teleport, anchoring the party at the threshold of Malakar’s fortress, where the fate of the kingdom will be decided.

## The Stakes

-   Malakar’s ritual drains King Alden’s essence. If the king falls, the binding magics protecting Eldoria unravel.
-   The relics are needed to counter the ritual and shield Elior from Malakar’s influence.

## The Relics and Their Trials

### 1) Crystal of Light — Courage (Sunken Ruins)

The journey leads to the coast where the sea swallows a shattered temple known as the Sunken Ruins. At dusk, stone causeways rise from the surf, slick with salt and seaweed. Spectral water-wardens—spirits bound to guard the ruins—test intruders with fear itself.

-   Trial: In the sanctum, the water spirits coalesce into a tide-born guardian that feeds on hesitation. The Crystal of Light responds only when Elior speaks a vow aloud—naming what, or whom, he will never abandon. The answer shall be 'myself'. His courage becomes a beacon that parts the flood and reveals the relic.

Result: Elior claims the Crystal. The causeways collapse behind them; the sea keeps its secrets.

### 2) Phoenix Feather — Wisdom (Mount Ember)

Mount Ember is an old volcano whose heart pulses with elemental puzzles. Its slopes are etched with obsidian channels and brass mirrors that once guided sunlight to a high altar.

-   Guardian: A phoenix wrought of ember and memory rises from a crater. It does not attack; it poses a riddle for Elior to answer: “What is wisdom when time is short?”

Result: The Phoenix offers a single Feather, warm as a heartbeat.

### 3) Dragon’s Scale — Selflessness (Caverns of Shadow)

Beneath Eldoria’s oldest hills, the Caverns of Shadow breathe a chill that dims torches. There, a dragon sleeps—not a beast of greed, but a creature of burdens, keeping darkness pinned beneath its coils.

-   The Dragon: Ancient, wise, and tired. It knows Elior’s parents’ names. It reveals they bargained their safety for a chance to hide Elior from Malakar. The dragon guards a scale that can ward a soul—but taking it without due cause weakens the prison it maintains.
-   Offering: Elior offers something of himself—a meaningful sacrifice of power or a binding pledge. The dragon yields the Scale when it believes the promise.

Result: The Scale is cold and heavy—a pledge as much as a relic. The caverns brighten, not with light, but with trust.

## Malakar’s Shadow and Parentage Hints

-   Letters and sigils resurface: Malakar’s early research mentions two apprentices who defied him—Elior’s parents.
-   In the Sunken Ruins, a mural shows a figure shielding a child from a storm of sigils.
-   In Mount Ember’s ash, footprints burned into stone are child-sized beside two adults’ strides.
-   The dragon names a place where the parents vanished from sight—not dead, but warded away.
