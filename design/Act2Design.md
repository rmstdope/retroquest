Massive trees create a natural cathedral as you enter the Enchanted Forest. Dappled sunlight filters through the dense canopy, and the path ahead disappears into green shadows. The air is alive with the sounds of birds and rustling leaves, but underneath lies an expectant silence, as if the forest itself is watching and waiting. Two paths diverge deeper into the forest - one leads to an ancient grove that serves as the sacred gateway to the forest's heart, while the other leads to a peaceful glade.
