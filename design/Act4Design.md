# Act IV: The Final Confrontation

## Narrative Overview

Act IV represents the climax of Elior's journey as they infiltrate Malakar's fortress with all 
three relics in hand. The act focuses on navigating deadly traps, confronting illusions, facing 
Malakar's lieutenants, and ultimately making critical moral choices that determine the fate of the 
kingdom. The fortress serves as both a physical and psychological battleground where Elior must 
prove their growth while resisting Malakar's corruption.

The act explores themes of forgiveness versus vengeance, trust versus doubt, and the true meaning 
of heroism. Through completing side quests that test each virtue represented by the relics 
(Courage, Wisdom, Selflessness), Elior gains the strength needed to face Malakar's ultimate 
temptation and the revelation about their parents.

## Quest Management Structure

### Main Quest Chain Architecture

The main quest "The Final Stand" is built from completing all side quests, following the design 
rule that all side quests must be completed before the main quest can be finished. The quest 
chain follows this dependency structure:

**Phase 1: Fortress Infiltration**

- All outer fortress side quests must be completed before accessing inner sanctum

**Phase 2: Lieutenant Confrontations**

- Each lieutenant encounter tests a different virtue and requires specific relic powers

**Phase 3: The Inner Sanctum**

- Final confrontation with Malakar only possible after all trials completed

corruption began when he tried to prevent the loss that took Elior's parents, leading to the 
very tragedy he sought to avoid.

## Spell System Design

- **Triumphant Light:** Combine all three relics for maximum power

- **Sacrificial Shield:** Scale + Crystal for protecting others

## World-Building & Lore Integration

### Malakar's Fortress

The fortress reflects Malakar's mental state - starting with organized defenses but becoming 
increasingly chaotic and desperate as players progress deeper. Each area tells the story of 
his fall from grace.

### The Corruption's Source

Revealed to be Malakar's attempt to reverse time and save Elior's parents, which instead 
created a temporal wound that consumes life energy.

### Kingdom's True History

The relics were originally created by an alliance between Malakar and Elior's parents to protect 
the kingdom, making the current conflict a tragic perversion of their original bond.

  interface

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Testing Scope

- **Quest Progression:** Each quest trigger, update, and completion with choice variations
