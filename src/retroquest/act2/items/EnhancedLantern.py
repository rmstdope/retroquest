"""Enhanced Lantern (Act II Item)

Narrative Role:
    One of the two complementary gating items required to safely penetrate the Enchanted Forest interior.
    Provides narrative and mechanical justification for navigation clarity and magical path revelation.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Special use logic only at ForestEntrance (contextual illumination & flag set).
    - Sets FLAG_ENHANCED_LANTERN_USED_FOREST_ENTRANCE upon first successful contextual use and renames itself
      to indicate its lit/active state (diegetic feedback in inventory listing).
    - Synergy message appears if the Protective Charm flag is already active (or will appear viceâ€‘versa from charm).
    - Combined with FLAG_PROTECTIVE_CHARM_USED_FOREST_ENTRANCE, unlocks additional exits when ForestEntrance.get_exits
      is queried (room reads both flags; lantern does not directly alter exits).

Story Flags:
    - Sets: FLAG_ENHANCED_LANTERN_USED_FOREST_ENTRANCE
    - Reads: FLAG_PROTECTIVE_CHARM_USED_FOREST_ENTRANCE (to emit synergy success messaging)

Progression Effects:
    One half of the dual-item gate for accessing AncientGrove and WhisperingGlade from ForestEntrance.

Design Notes:
    - Keeps gating passive; room logic centralizes exit mutation, avoiding duplicated unlocking code here.
    - Name mutation communicates persistent active state without additional UI hooks.
    - Non-contextual use provides lore / generic effect description for clarity outside intended room.
