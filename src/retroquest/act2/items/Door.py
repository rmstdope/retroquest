"""Door (Act II Structural Item)

Narrative Role:
    Architectural element representing the barrier to Silver Stag Inn private rooms. Provides environmental realism
    while reinforcing key-based progression.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - use() contextual hint only when in SilverStagInn; otherwise generic inaccessibility message.
    - use_with delegates unlocking to RoomKey which handles exit mutation via SilverStagInn.use_key().

Story Flags:
    - Sets/Reads: (none)

Progression Effects:
    Serves as tangible affordance for the RoomKey unlocking moment; no direct narrative mutation itself.

Design Notes:
    - Keeping door logic minimal prevents proliferation of lock state duplicationâ€”room retains source of truth.
    - Could later adopt standardized Lockable interface if more interactive door types emerge.
