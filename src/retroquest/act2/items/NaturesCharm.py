"""Nature's Charm (Act II Sacred Item)

Narrative Role:
    One of the triad of sacred charms (with DruidicCharm and ProtectiveCharm) necessary to complete the Offering
    Altar ritual summoning Nyxâ€”manifestation of ancient forest agency.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - use_with delegates to OfferingAltar for centralized ritual validation & execution.
    - Passive otherwise; generic carrying confers no direct stat or flag effect pre-ritual.

Story Flags:
    - Sets: (none)
    - Reads: (none)

Progression Effects:
    Required ritual component enabling Nyx encounter; opens narrative channels for trials, lore, or future spell access.

Design Notes:
    - Maintains symmetry with other charm implementations; avoids bespoke logic proliferation.
    - Could receive optional synergy messaging in a future enhancement if inspected with other charms present.
