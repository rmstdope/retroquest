"""Coins (Act II Economy Item)

Narrative Role:
    Core currency resource enabling acquisition of supplies, gear, and potentially quest services within Greendale.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Maintains internal mutable integer balance (self.amount) with spend() helper performing guarded decrements.
    - use() provides current balance feedback; description kept synchronized after each spend.
    - Functions as a single inventory item representing a pouch rather than discrete coin stacking.

Story Flags:
    - Sets/Reads: (none) â€” currency state isolated from narrative progression flags.

Progression Effects:
    Facilitates market interactions and preparation gates (e.g., purchasing survival gear) without directly unlocking narrative beats.

Design Notes:
    - If future systems require persistence across acts, consider migrating amount into GameState economy subsystem.
    - Potential extension: log transactions for quest auditing or introduce denominations.
