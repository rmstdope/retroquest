"""Druidic Focus (Act II Item)

Narrative Role:
	Ritual attunement implement used by practitioners of natural magic. Provides thematic grounding for
	interactions that bridge arcane spell structure and living ecological energies.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
	- Currently purely descriptive; no active use() override. Serves as a potential prerequisite for
	  advanced druidic rites or amplification of nature-themed spells.

Story Flags:
	- Sets: (none)
	- Reads: (none)

Progression Effects:
	Atmospheric now; can become gating equipment for future multi-stage forest rituals or crafting systems.

Design Notes:
	- Lightweight implementation to preserve forward design flexibility.
	- If later empowered, consider adding a focus tier system or resonance charges tracked via flags.
