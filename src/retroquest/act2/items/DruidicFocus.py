    """Attunement implement reinforcing natural magic themes and future ritual gating.

    Purpose:
        Establishes the concept of physical foci channeling ecological / primal energies
        before advanced druidic systems unlock.

    Mechanics:
        Purely descriptive presently; no ``use`` override. May later act as prerequisite
        for nature spell amplification or multi-stage grove rites.

    Design Notes:
        Minimal now to preserve design flexibility; future enhancements could introduce
        resonance tiers or attunement charges tracked via story flags.
