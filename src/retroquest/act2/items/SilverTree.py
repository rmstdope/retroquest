"""Silver-Barked Tree (Act II Environmental Item)

Narrative Role:
    Majestic living monument in the Ancient Grove acting as the manifestation point for the Ancient Tree Spirit
    when respectfully examined. Serves as a lore delivery anchor and spiritual nexus.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Non-carriable environmental feature; single-use (per instance) examination toggles internal examined flag.
    - On first examine within AncientGrove: instantiates AncientTreeSpirit NPC into the current room (dynamic population).
    - Subsequent examines provide ambient reinforcement text without spawning duplicates.

Story Flags:
    - Sets/Reads: (none directly) â€” ephemeral state tracked locally via self.examined.

Progression Effects:
    Gate for introducing AncientTreeSpirit interactions which may yield quests, lore, or future magical boons.

Design Notes:
    - Uses local boolean instead of global story flag since scope is confined to room narrative.
    - Pattern applicable to other awakening-style environmental encounters (could be abstracted later).
