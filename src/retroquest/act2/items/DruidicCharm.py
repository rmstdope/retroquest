"""Druidic Charm (Act II Sacred Item)

Narrative Role:
    One of the three sacred charms required for the Offering Altar ritual to summon Nyx. Gifted in gratitude,
    it thematically binds acts of protection and healing with ancient natural stewardship.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Contextual messaging in Heart of the Forest hints at altar placement purpose.
    - Delegates multi-item ritual handling to OfferingAltar via use_with pattern (centralized validation).
    - examine() enriches provenance and emotional weight of the gift event.

Story Flags:
    - Sets: (none directly)
    - Reads: (none)

Progression Effects:
    Required (with ProtectiveCharm and Nature's Charm) to summon Nyxâ€”gateway to deeper forest narrative layers.

Design Notes:
    - Avoids embedding ritual logic locally to prevent duplication across charm classes.
    - Could later gain resonance interactions (e.g., boosting nature spell potency) after Nyx encounter.
