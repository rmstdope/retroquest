"""Advanced healing potion item: potent restorative future combat balancing hook."""

    """High-tier curative consumable placeholder.

    Purpose:
        Reserved for later encounter tuning (mid-act spike recovery or boss prep) so
        early scaffolding exists for inventory, UI, and potential crafting trees.

    Mechanics:
        Currently inert (no specialized ``use`` override) to avoid premature balance
        shifts. Will later restore significant health or cleanse multi-effect debuffs.

    Design Notes:
        Introduced early to anchor narrative hints (alchemical refinement, apothecary
        requests). Implementation deferred until core combat / damage systems mature.
