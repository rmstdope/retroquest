"""Protective Enchantments (Act II Environmental Item)

Narrative Role:
    Environmental magical barrier inside the ancient library signifying restricted knowledge protection.
    Serves as visual / interactive indicator that restoration work is required before accessing deeper lore.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Non-carriable static item; player cannot pick up or directly use (examine driven interaction).
    - examine() output branches based on FLAG_MENDED_LIBRARY_ENCHANTMENTS to reflect repair progress.
    - use_item() overridden to supply clarifying feedback about non-usability.

Story Flags:
    - Reads: FLAG_MENDED_LIBRARY_ENCHANTMENTS
    - Sets: (none) â€” state mutation performed elsewhere by restoration quest logic/spells.

Progression Effects:
    Feedback surface for completion of library restoration tasks prerequisite to accessing certain texts (e.g., AncientChronicle study gating).

Design Notes:
    - Pure presentation layer; keeps narrative clarity without embedding quest logic here.
    - Pattern for other environmental magical constructs (wards, seals, barriers) emphasizing examine() state reflection.
