"""Camp Site (Act II Environmental Discovery Item)

Narrative Role:
    Abandoned resting point that rewards attentive exploration with an Entry Pass find, reinforcing early-game
    preparation and world lived-in texture.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Non-carriable; single-use examination spawns an EntryPass into the room (idempotent via self.examined flag).
    - use() delegates to examine() if not yet searched to streamline player interaction.

Story Flags:
    - Sets/Reads: (none) â€” discovery handled locally without global progression dependency.

Progression Effects:
    Provides alternate acquisition path for city access credential (Entry Pass) if player missed another source.

Design Notes:
    - Could later track discovery via a FLAG_FOUND_CAMP_SITE for completion metrics; currently intentionally lean.
    - Pattern reusable for other micro-discovery nodes (e.g., caches, shrines) with minimal boilerplate.
