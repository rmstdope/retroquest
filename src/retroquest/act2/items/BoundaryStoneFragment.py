"""Boundary Stone Fragment (Act II Lore Fragment Item)

Narrative Role:
	Shard of an ancient territorial or ley alignment marker once used to delineate protective forest boundaries.
	Hints at deeper geomantic infrastructure sustaining balance between civilized and wild domains.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
	- Currently inert flavor collectible; no special use() override.
	- Could later combine with additional fragments to reconstruct a full warding stone (multi-part artifact pattern).

Story Flags:
	- Sets/Reads: (none)

Progression Effects:
	None nowâ€”seed for future optional restoration quest or environmental stabilizing ritual.

Design Notes:
	- Keep minimal until broader ley-line system or artifact assembly mechanic is introduced.
	- Naming aligns with potential set: BoundaryStoneFragmentA/B etc. if multiple needed later.
