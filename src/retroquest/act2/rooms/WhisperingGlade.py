    """Tranquil forest clearing with latent lore potential (Act II).

    Narrative Role:
        Provides a quiet tonal contrast to denser forest areas and a future anchor
        for nature, riddle, or restorative interactions.

    Current Mechanics:
        Pass-through location reached after prerequisite flags at Forest Entrance; presently no
        interactive items or characters.

    Planned Features:
        Potential water nymph riddle system, restorative buffs, or nature-aligned spell unlocks.

    Design Notes:
        Minimal implementation keeps the space flexible. When adding riddles, standardize an
        'answer <text>' verb across puzzle rooms.
