    """Restorative cottage supporting future advanced healing interactions.

    Narrative Role:
        Provides a quiet location associated with recovery and potential future
        spell or ritual learning through the resident healer.

    Key Mechanics:
        - Maintains ``emergency_healing_used`` boolean (reserved for later oneâ€‘
          time aid or scripted event).

    Story Flags:
        - None currently (state local; may promote to flag when shared logic is
          required across rooms).

    Contents:
        - NPC: ``MasterHealerLyria``.
        - Items: None (ambiance only for now).

    Design Notes:
        Kept deliberately minimal; healing actions should likely live on the
        character class rather than room to maintain single responsibility.
