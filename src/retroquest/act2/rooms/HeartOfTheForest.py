"""Heart of the Forest room: climactic ritual sanctum with offering altar."""

    """Climactic inner sanctum emphasizing ritual and revelation.

    Narrative Role:
        Highâ€‘magic focal space associated with Nyx and late-act lore delivery.
        Access already validated by upstream gating (AncientGrove path).

    Key Mechanics:
        - Static exits; contains ``OfferingAltar`` as ritual interaction hub.

    Story Flags:
        - Reads none directly; future altar interactions may set offering or
          blessing flags.

    Contents:
        - Item: ``OfferingAltar``.
        - Characters: None currently (sprite manifestation externalized).

    Design Notes:
        Kept static to focus player attention on event sequencing; could evolve
        into a ``RitualChamber`` specialization if multiple similar arenas are
        introduced.
