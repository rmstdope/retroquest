"""Heart of the Forest (Act II)

Narrative Role:
    Climactic inner sanctum of the Enchanted Forest tied to Nyx encounter and high-magic revelations.

Key Mechanics:
    - Access path funneled through AncientGrove gating; this room itself hosts ritual focal point (OfferingAltar).
    - No dynamic exits or local gatingâ€”serves as resolution / ritual arena.

Story Flags:
    - Reads none directly; progression assumed validated upstream.
    - Potential future: altar interactions may set offering / blessing flags.

Contents:
    - Item: OfferingAltar (interaction hub for sprite / ritual logic).
    - Characters: None initially (sprite may manifest contextually elsewhere or be added later).

Design Notes:
    - Intentionally static to keep attention on invoked event sequences rather than navigation.
    - If multiple ritual arenas appear across acts, consider abstract RitualChamber base specialization.
