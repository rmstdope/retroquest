class HiddenLibrary(Room):
    """Secret subterranean archive providing lore and defensive preparation.

    Narrative Role:
        Revealed only after searching the residential quarter; delivers midâ€‘act
        exposition and grants defensive progression via protective enchantments.

    Key Mechanics:
        - Access gating performed externally; room remains statically defined.

    Story Flags:
        - Reads none directly; availability implies discovery flag set earlier.

    Contents:
        - Items: ``AncientChronicle``, ``ProtectiveEnchantments``.
        - NPC: ``SpectralLibrarian`` (future spell pedagogy hook).

    Design Notes:
        Minimal surface keeps spotlight on discovery moment; expandable with
        research or conditional dialogue systems later.
