"""Master Merchant Aldric (Act II)

Role:
    Premium gear vendor unlocking higher-tier utility items after social proof (flyer) is presented.

Unlock Condition:
    - Requires giving MerchantsFlyer (sets internal gave_flyer) before wares list becomes accessible.

Economy & Inventory:
    - Stocks: ForestSurvivalKit (50), EnhancedLantern (40), QualityRope (20).
    - Uses coin batching via GameState.get_item_count / remove_item_from_inventory for atomic purchases.

Narrative Flavor:
    - Rotating marketing-style dialogue lines reinforce merchant personality and world commerce tone.

Design Notes:
    - No story flags; containment ensures reuse pattern for future merchants.
    - Item restocking hook (add_wares) called upon flyer validationâ€”room controls display items separately from purchased copies.
    - Safety checks guard against duplicate acquisition and payment race conditions.
