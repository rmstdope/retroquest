"""Town Crier (Act II)

Role:
    Ambient exposition NPC delivering broad hooks (Sir Cedric seeking aid, notice board mention)
    that funnel early Act II players toward central activity hubs.

Function:
    - Single static informative dialogue establishing civic vibrancy and quest availability.
    - No state, flags, or branching; intentionally reliable repeating information source.

Design Notes:
    - Could later rotate announcements based on major act flags (e.g., honor restored) without
      altering baseline signature.
    - Simplicity improves performanceâ€”no imports beyond engine basics.
