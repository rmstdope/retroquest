"""Castle Guard Captain (Act II)

Role:
    Frontline protocol NPC at Greendale's castle grounds who orients the player toward
    Sir Cedric and establishes courtly tone and respect conventions.

Key Interactions / Gating:
    - Provides guidance directing the player to speak with Sir Cedric in the courtyard.
    - Light narrative framing only; does not gate quests with flags, but reinforces
      thematic expectations of honor and proper address prior to engaging Cedric's arcs.

Story Flags Influenced:
    - None directly. Purely informational / atmospheric to strengthen setting.

Rewards & Progression Impact:
    - No tangible reward. Serves as a soft signpost toward knightly quest lines
      (e.g., Cedric's honor / training related content) and helps new players orient.

Design Notes:
    - Kept intentionally minimal for quick early interaction in Greendale.
    - Avoids flag usage to remain a stable ambient guidance source.
    - If future complexity is added (like formal salute requirements), integrate
      via an act-specific etiquette flagâ€”do not overload this class.
