"""Forest Hermit NPC definition.

Role:
    Transitional wilderness mentor who provides protective charm and activates
    the "Hermit's Warning" quest sequence (``FLAG_HERMITS_WARNING_ACCEPTED``) to
    gate deeper forest traversal with preparatory lore.

Key Mechanics:
    - First interaction grants ``ProtectiveCharm`` item and sets acceptance flag.
    - Subsequent talks reinforce guidance (non-repetitive reward logic).

Design Notes:
    Uses internal booleans to prevent duplicate charm distribution. Leaves quest
    completion mechanics to external forest transition logic per modular design.
