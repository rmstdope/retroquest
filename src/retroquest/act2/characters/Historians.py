"""Historians (Act II)

Role:
    Scholarly review collective validating genealogical and regional lore artifacts. Bridges
    raw discovery (player reads TravelersJournal) with authoritative confirmation, lending
    narrative weight to heritage revelations.

Flow:
    - Player must read TravelersJournal first (FLAG_READ_TRAVELERS_JOURNAL) before presenting it;
      otherwise receives cautionary failure advising self-understanding.
    - Successful presentation sets FLAG_SHOWED_JOURNAL_TO_HISTORIANS delivering affirmation dialogue.

Story Flags:
    - Reads: FLAG_READ_TRAVELERS_JOURNAL, FLAG_SHOWED_JOURNAL_TO_HISTORIANS
    - Sets: FLAG_SHOWED_JOURNAL_TO_HISTORIANS

Design Notes:
    - Ensures lore is not passively forwardedâ€”player must internalize content (read flag) first.
    - Prevents duplicate state spam by idempotent early return once flag set.
    - Future extension: Could unlock deeper archive tiers or cross-reference other relics if additional
      genealogical artifacts introduced.
