"""Local Craftsmen (Act II)

Role:
        Collective artisan NPC representing Greendale's skilled working guilds. Acts as the
        in-world tutor granting the player the Mend spell once they've demonstrated civic virtue.

Gating Logic:
        - Requires story flag FLAG_HELPED_ELDERLY_RESIDENTS == True (earned by assisting
            Families / elderly with a Walking Stick) before dialogue becomes welcoming.
        - First successful post-gate interaction awards the Mend spell (utility + thematic
            reinforcement of restorative, community-focused play style).

Story Flags Consumed / Set:
        - Reads: FLAG_HELPED_ELDERLY_RESIDENTS
        - Does not set new flags; instead confers a spell reward once.

Rewards & Progression:
        - Grants spell 'mend' (via learn_spell) if not already known after gating condition.
        - Subsequent interactions become flavor / affirmation of player's contribution.

Design Notes:
        - Spell learning implemented through observation rather than direct teaching to
            vary acquisition modality versus formal mentor NPCs.
        - Avoids additional flags to keep complexity low and self-contained.
        - If future crafting systems are added, this class could become a hubâ€”migrate
            extended logic into an engine service to keep narrative clarity.
