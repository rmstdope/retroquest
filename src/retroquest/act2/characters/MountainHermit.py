"""Mountain Hermit (Act II)

Role:
        Transitional mentor stationed between Willowbrook and Greendale who gifts the Training
        Sword and foreshadows escalating regional threats, thematically bridging Acts I & II.

Interaction Mechanics:
        - On first talk_to(): sets internal warned flag and (if not already) grants TrainingSword
            via helper method for narrative pacing.
        - Subsequent talks reinforce motivational guidance and confirm sword possession.

State Tracking (instance attributes):
        - sword_given: ensures the Training Sword cannot be duplicated.
        - warned_about_times: controls delivery of initial prophetic warning block.

Items Granted:
        - TrainingSword (non-combat symbolic credential used to gain trust / prove skill in
            Greendale training contexts and potential gating with martial NPCs).

Design Notes:
        - Uses helper method give_training_sword_with_dialogue to consolidate reward flow.
        - Maintains narrative gravitas while remaining mechanically simpleâ€”does not set
            story flags to keep early Act II onboarding clean.
        - If later balancing requires gating Cedric's test, a story flag could be added when
            sword is granted; keep hermit self-contained otherwise.
