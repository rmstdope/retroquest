"""The Ancient Library Quest Module.

Discovers and explores the hidden subterranean archive beneath Greendale.

Trigger Conditions:
- Activated when the player uncovers the secret passage and accepts entry, setting
    ``FLAG_ANCIENT_LIBRARY_ACCEPTED``.

Core Objectives (implicit):
1. Gain access to the spectral librarian / arcane stacks.
2. Acquire the Crystal Focus item (enhances later magical interactions/mechanics).
3. Learn the ``dispel`` spell from recovered tomes / spectral tutoring.

Completion Logic:
- Quest completes when both the ``dispel`` spell is known AND the player possesses
    the ``Crystal Focus`` item. These two conditions gate Act II main quest narrative
    advancement (knowledge & lineage revelation).

Lore / Narrative Impact:
- Reveals prophetic material concerning the Chosen One lineage and establishes
    the player's heritage link. Provides early midâ€‘act power escalation while keeping
    forest progression balanced.
