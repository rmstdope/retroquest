"""Supplies for the Journey Quest Module.

This quest ensures the player properly prepares before deeper forest exploration.

Trigger Conditions:
- Activated after proving combat skill (``FLAG_DEMONSTRATED_COMBAT_SKILLS``) to Sir Cedric.

Objectives:
- Acquire three prerequisite items from the Market District vendors:
    * Forest Survival Kit
    * Enhanced Lantern
    * Quality Rope

Completion Logic:
- When all three items are present in inventory the quest marks complete and sets
    ``FLAG_SUPPLIES_QUEST_COMPLETED``. This flag is referenced by the Act II main
    quest progression and subsequent forestâ€‘entry gating.

Design Notes:
- Uses ``isinstance`` checks against concrete item classes to avoid name collisions.
- Does not award experience directly; pacing handled through main / composite quests.
