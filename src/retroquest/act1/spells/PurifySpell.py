"""Purify Spell (Act I / Cross-Act Utility)

Purpose:
    Cleansing spell that removes corruption or impurities from environmental targets (e.g., wells, warding artifacts) once full magic capability is unlocked.

Gating:
    - Requires story flag "magic_fully_unlocked"; otherwise fizzlesâ€”establishes progressive magic growth.

Core Mechanics:
    - cast_on_item:
        * Well -> delegates to Well.purify(game_state).
        * WardingPillars (Act III) -> delegates to room hook cast_purify_on_pillars enabling narrative flexibility.
        * Generic item -> fallback flavor message.
    - cast_spell / cast_on_character share gating + flavor.

Story Flags:
    - Reads: magic_fully_unlocked (string literal presently; candidate for central constant extraction).
    - Does not set flags itself.

Design Notes:
    - Uses delegation rather than embedding purification details to keep spell slim and reusable across acts.
    - Room hook pattern (cast_purify_on_pillars) allows environment-specific branching without coupling here.
    - Consider future mechanic: sanctify accumulation or purity meter.
