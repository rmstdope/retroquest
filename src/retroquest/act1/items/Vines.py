"""Vines Item

Narrative Role:
Destructible environmental obstacle that converts into a resource (`Stick`)
when overcome, illustrating clearance + yield pattern.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- `use_with` + `SharpKnife` removes vines from room, consumes the knife, spawns a `Stick` item.
- Delegates fallback behavior to base for non-supported tools.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Persistence handled by removing item from room.

Progression Effects:
- Teaches that environmental barriers can produce salvage materials.

Design Notes:
- Knife destruction adds cost weight to clearing; encourages timing choice.
- Could later variabilize outputs (multiple sticks, fiber) if crafting deepens.
