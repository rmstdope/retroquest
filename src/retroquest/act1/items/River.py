"""River Item

Narrative Role:
Dynamic natural feature enabling fishing interactions and skill/knowledge gating (requires learned basics). Serves as a repeatable but state-limited resource source.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- `use_with` + `FishingRod` checks a story flag (`learned_fishing_basics`) before permitting catch.
- Single-catch logic via `fish_available` flag; subsequent attempts yield failure until reset (future extension).
- Updates description after fish caught (currently assigned with trailing commaâ€”future cleanup candidate).

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
- Reads: `learned_fishing_basics` (gates success)
- Sets: (none)

Progression Effects:
- Reinforces skill acquisition gating and natural resource harvesting loop.

Design Notes:
- Could introduce respawn timer or multiple fish types influenced by time-of-day or bait.
- Consider centralizing fishing logic if additional water bodies added.
