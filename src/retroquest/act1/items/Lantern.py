"""Lantern Item

Narrative Role:
Primary early-game light source revealing hidden items and reinforcing the concept that using an item can alter the environment (spawning new items).

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- First use transforms the item (renames to ``lantern (lit)``) and reveals `Bread` and `EliorsJournal` in the current room.
- Subsequent uses report that it is already lit (idempotent state change).
- Light emission abstracted; no ongoing fuel tracking.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Environmental reveal handled directly; no global progression flags.

Progression Effects:
- Teaches players that some items modify the room inventory, encouraging revisiting spaces with newly acquired tools.

Design Notes:
- Uses name mutation plus `short_name` alignment to maintain consistent command targeting.
- Consider future abstraction for light-producing items if additional variants appear (e.g., magical lantern, torch).
