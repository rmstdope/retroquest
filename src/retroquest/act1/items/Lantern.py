"""Lantern Item

Narrative Role:
    Primary early-game light source revealing hidden items and reinforcing the concept that
    using an item can alter the environment (spawning new items).

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - First use transforms the item (renames to ``lantern (lit)``) and reveals ``Bread`` and
      ``EliorsJournal`` in the current room.
    - Subsequent uses report that it is already lit (idempotent state change).
    - Light emission abstracted; no ongoing fuel tracking.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
    (none) â€“ environmental reveal handled directly; no global progression flags.

Progression Effects:
    - Teaches players that some items modify the room inventory, encouraging revisiting
      spaces with newly acquired tools.

Design Notes:
    - Uses name mutation plus ``short_name`` alignment to maintain consistent command targeting.
    - Future abstraction possible for broader light-producing item hierarchy.

class Lantern(Item):
    """Primary early-game light source that reveals hidden items on first use.

    Behavior:
        - First activation renames the item to ``lantern (lit)`` while keeping ``short_name``
          stable for command resolution.
        - Spawns ``Bread`` and ``EliorsJournal`` into the current room (environment reveal
          pattern) and becomes idempotent afterward.
        - Subsequent uses simply report that it is already lit.

    Design Notes:
        Lightweight state tracking via name mutation avoids an extra boolean attribute.
        Future refactors could extract a shared ``LightSource`` mixin if more luminous items
        appear.
