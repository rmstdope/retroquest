"""Act I navigation aid item: Map.

Narrative Role:
    Provides an in-world justification for the player's growing spatial awareness and serves
    as the catalyst for concluding Act I when consulted at the correct location.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Basic ``use`` returns a flavorful study message (non-consumable).
    - Using the map while in the "Road to Greendale" room triggers the act completion flag
      (``FLAG_SHADOWS_OVER_WILLOWBROOK_COMPLETED``), representing Elior confidently charting the
      onward journey.

Story Flags (Sets):
    - ``FLAG_SHADOWS_OVER_WILLOWBROOK_COMPLETED`` (when used in the correct room)

Story Flags (Reads):
    (none) â€“ the item only evaluates the current room name.

Progression Effects:
    Unlocks transition to Act II once the player has naturally reached the outward road and
    intentionally examined their map, tying exploration to narrative readiness.

Design Notes:
    - Keeps logic intentionally lightweight; expansion hooks exist for revealing dynamic exits
      or marking discovered landmarks later.
    - Room name comparison is case-insensitive via ``lower()`` to avoid brittle matching.
