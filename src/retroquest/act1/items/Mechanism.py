"""Mechanism Item

Narrative Role:
    Central repair puzzle object in the mill context. Encourages combining a structural aid
    (``Rope``) to restore function and reveal a hidden component (``MillstoneFragment``).

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - ``use_with`` + ``Rope`` repairs, consumes rope, spawns ``MillstoneFragment``, sets
      ``repaired`` state, updates description.
    - Post-repair examine/listen feedback differentiates pre/post states.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
    (none) â€“ local boolean state only.

Progression Effects:
    - Advances mill-related discovery; introduces concealed compartment reveal pattern.

Design Notes:
    - Pre-refactor code used a trailing comma on a description assignment (creating a tuple);
      that has been corrected here.
    - Could emit a flag for global narrative reactions (e.g., mill operational status) later.
