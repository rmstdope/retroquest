"""Bucket Item

Narrative Role:
Early utility container that teaches players about combining items with environmental features. Drawing water is a simple formative interaction reinforcing examination and experimentation in Act I.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Can be used with the `well` (the `Well` item) to obtain a filled variant (renames itself to ``bucket (full)``) the first time it is used while empty.
- Idempotent fill: attempting to fill an already full bucket returns a failure message without changing state.
- Potential future hook for water-based progression (e.g., dousing fire, softening soil) via state check on name or added property.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Current implementation relies only on item-local state (its name) rather than global story flags.

Progression Effects:
- Introduces dynamic item state changes (renaming) early in the game loop.
- May be leveraged later for light environmental puzzles; presently self-contained.

Design Notes:
- Uses name mutation instead of a separate boolean property to mark fullness to keep engine changes minimal.
- If expanded, prefer adding an explicit property (e.g., ``set_property('is_full', True)``) for clarity rather than parsing the name.
- Retains carry status after filling (no weight system implemented yet).
