"""Matches Item

Narrative Role:
Basic ignition source enabling illumination and ritual flavor actions (e.g., lighting candles or a lantern). Reinforces delegated interaction pattern with target items.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Pickup can be blocked by the shopkeeper until purchased (`prevent_pickup`).
- When used with a `Candle`, delegates logic to the candle's `use_with`, allowing candle to control its lit state and side effects.
- Otherwise defers to base combination handling.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Lighting actions currently self-contained.

Progression Effects:
- Establishes that certain enabling tools (like matches) unlock latent states in other items (candles, lanterns) rather than doing something standalone.

Design Notes:
- Could be extended with limited charges (match count) if resource management is introduced.
- Maintains simplicity by not tracking a lit state itself; targets own their ignition state.
