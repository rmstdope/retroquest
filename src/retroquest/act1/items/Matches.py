"""Matches Item

Narrative Role:
    Basic ignition source enabling illumination and ritual flavor actions (e.g., lighting
    candles or a lantern). Reinforces delegated interaction pattern with target items.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
    - Pickup can be blocked by the shopkeeper until purchased (``prevent_pickup``).
    - When used with a ``Candle``, delegates logic to the candle's ``use_with`` so the candle
      controls its lit state and side effects.
    - Otherwise defers to base combination handling.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
    (none) â€“ lighting actions currently self-contained.

Progression Effects:
    - Shows that enabling tools (like matches) unlock latent states in other items (candles,
      lanterns) rather than doing something standalone.

Design Notes:
    - Could be extended with limited charges (match count) if resource management arrives.
    - Simplicity preserved by not tracking a lit state itself; targets own their ignition state.
