"""Armor Item

Narrative Role:
Early defensive gear establishing the concept of protective equipment without yet integrating numerical mitigation mechanics.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Basic `equip` and `examine` flows; no durability or stat calculations.
- Mirrors acquisition gating pattern with shopkeeper via `prevent_pickup`.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Purely descriptive at this stage.

Progression Effects:
- Reinforces preparation loop (procure weapon + armor) ahead of deeper mechanical systems.

Design Notes:
- Parallel structure to `Sword` maintains consistency in UX.
- Future: introduce armor tiers or conditional dialogue when equipped in specific encounters.
