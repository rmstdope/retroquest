"""AncientAmulet Item

Narrative Role:
Powerful heirloom artifact intentionally withheld early to establish narrative guardianship
and foreshadow magical systems and responsibility themes.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Always blocks pickup via `prevent_pickup` dialogue from Mira, signaling preparation
prerequisites (not yet mechanically enforced beyond message).

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Gating currently narrative only.

Progression Effects:
- Builds anticipation for later acquisition, reinforcing preparation arc.

Design Notes:
- Future: replace unconditional block with conditional check (e.g., all preparation flags set)
    then allow carry.
- Potential synergy with rune/spell affinity once magical attunement is introduced.
