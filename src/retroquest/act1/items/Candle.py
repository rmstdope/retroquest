"""Candle Item

Narrative Role:
Small light source that reveals hidden object (Locket) when lit, teaching players
that illumination can alter room item sets.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- `use_with` + `Matches` lights candle (idempotent) and spawns `Locket` exactly once.
- Sets internal `is_lit` state; subsequent attempts produce failure feedback.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Relies on simple state toggling.

Progression Effects:
- Reinforces environment reactivity to item-driven state changes (vision gating pattern).

Design Notes:
- Could generalize into a LightSource base if more reveal-light items appear.
