"""Apple Item

Narrative Role:
Basic consumable-style food item establishing village economy flavor and shop ownership gating
pattern. Serves as a harmless early example of merchant-protected goods.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Pickup may be blocked by shopkeeper until purchased (``prevent_pickup`` checks
    `can_be_carried_flag`).
- Currently no consumption mechanic; persists in inventory as flavor/ potential barter object.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Ownership/permission enforced locally via pickup prevention.

Progression Effects:
- Reinforces that mundane items can still require proper acquisition steps.

Design Notes:
- Future extension: add a `consume` method to restore minor health or morale when a health
    system is introduced.
