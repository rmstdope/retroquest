"""Sword Item

Narrative Role:
Found or purchased early as a foundational combat/heroism symbol. Provides flavor and potential future combat stat hooks without current mechanical modifiers.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- Standard equip/examine/use messaging; no durability or combat math yet.
- `equip` provides atmospheric confirmation; could later apply stat bonuses via `GameState` or player attributes.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ No direct progression gating presently.

Progression Effects:
- Signals preparedness for future threats; psychologically rewards acquisition even before combat is implemented.

Design Notes:
- Separation of `use` and `equip` retains flexibility for future differentiation (e.g., `use` could perform context-sensitive actions while equipped state persists).
- Could add `is_equipped` property if engine or character stats expand.
