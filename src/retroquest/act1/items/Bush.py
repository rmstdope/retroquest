"""Bush Item

Narrative Role:
Environment vegetation that can be magically stimulated to generate forage (wild berries),
demonstrating renewable resource mechanics gated by spell use.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- `grow` (triggered via spell externally) adds `WildBerries` if not already present in room.
- Idempotent production prevents duplication spam in single cycle.

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ Room inventory presence provides implicit state.

Progression Effects:
- Introduces transformation of static environment into resource node via magic.

Design Notes:
- Could track depletion/regrowth timers if resource economy expands.
