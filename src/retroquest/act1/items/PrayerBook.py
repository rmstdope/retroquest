"""PrayerBook Item

Narrative Role:
Religious/cultural artifact grounding village spirituality while hinting at latent mystical
currents (shifting runes). Bridges mundane faith and arcane systems.

Key Mechanics / Interactions:
- `read` produces atmospheric text with subtle arcane foreshadowing.
- Non-portable vs. portable distinction: currently carriable (could be restricted later
if needed).

Story Flags (Sets / Reads):
(none) â€“ No tracking of whether player has read it yet.

Progression Effects:
- Enhances lore density; primes player for later ritual/spell incantation structures.

Design Notes:
- Could set a flag on first read to unlock evolved description or NPC dialogue variants.
