class HiddenGlade(Room):
    """Stateful enchanted clearing featuring conditional spawn and spell teaching.

    Narrative Role:
        Optional discovery zone blending environment ambience with first nature-aligned
        spell acquisition (``Grow``) and conditional wildlife appearance.

    Key Mechanics:
        - ``rest()``: If story flag ``'deer_can_be_observed'`` set and deer absent,
          spawns ``Deer`` + ``RareFlower``.
        - ``light()``: Grants ``Grow`` if not known; toggles internal illumination
          state altering description tone.
        - ``describe()`` rebuilds description from dynamic segments each call.

    Story Flags:
        - Reads: ``'deer_can_be_observed'`` (string literalâ€”candidate for constant).
        - Sets: None locally.

    Contents:
        - Items: ``ShinyPebble``; conditional ``RareFlower``.
        - NPC: Conditional ``Deer``.
        - Spell: ``Grow`` via illumination event.

    Design Notes:
        Future refactor: unify dynamic description pattern across similar rooms.
