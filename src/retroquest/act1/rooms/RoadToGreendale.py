"""Road to Greendale (Act I)

Narrative Role:
    Transitional outbound route signaling shift from sheltered village life to broader regional journey.

Key Mechanics:
    - Simple linear exit design; staging area for encounter or travel preparation events.

Story Flags:
    - None currently; future travel milestones or ambush events could attach here.

Contents:
    - Items: RustySaw (tool), potential TravelCloak (import present but not currently addedâ€”candidate for inclusion or removal),
      enabling light equipment provisioning.
    - NPC: Merchant (economic teaser / bridge to larger markets in Act II).

Design Notes:
    - Consider adding conditional exit enabling once certain village quests complete to reinforce narrative readiness.
    - Review unused TravelCloak import if item intentionally withheld (maybe reward gating) to avoid confusion.
