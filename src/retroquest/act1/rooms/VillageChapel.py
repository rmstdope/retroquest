"""Village Chapel (Act I)

Narrative Role:
    Spiritual focal point offering blessing atmosphere and potential future moral or alignment mechanics.

Key Mechanics:
    - Static configuration (no dynamic exits or discovery) emphasizing reflective tone.
    - Hidden locket referenced in flavor text (not yet implementedâ€”potential searchable item hook).

Story Flags:
    - None at present; future blessing/confession systems could introduce them.

Contents:
    - Items: Candle (light / ritual potential), PrayerBook (lore / devotional flavor).
    - NPC: Priest (blessings, guidance, quest hint potential).

Design Notes:
    - Consider adding a gentle search reward (locket) to model exploration reinforcement consistent with later rooms.
    - Could later act as resurrection / penalty mitigation site if difficulty escalates.
