"""Village Well (Act I)

Narrative Role:
    Central mystical-feeling utility structure; atmospheric locus for future purification or divination mechanics.

Key Mechanics:
    - Static exit hub with mild environmental intrigue; Well item enables water/purification interactions later.

Story Flags:
    - None yet; potential future flags for purified water, revealed secret, or wish events.

Contents:
    - Item: Well (interactive environmental object with likely custom verbs in expansion).
    - Characters: Noneâ€”solitary ambiance preserved.

Design Notes:
    - Opportunity for early subtle foreshadowing of deeper magical systems.
    - Could spawn event-driven character (seer, spirit) after meeting certain cross-room conditions.
